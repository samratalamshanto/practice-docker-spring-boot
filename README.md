# practice-docker-spring-boot
## Develop a Simple Spring Boot Project. Here, we mainly focus on how to use docker in the projects. 
1. First use PostgreSQL as a Database. Pull the Postgres docker image run it in the container and use that database.
2. Build an image for the application.
3. Build a Docker-compose file and run the application in the container using the Docker network.
4. Use docker volume to persist the data in the host location using data mount.
